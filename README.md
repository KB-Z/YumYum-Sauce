Taco Project (Gimme Tacos!)

First HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery Project


Goal ----

Create a webpage to generate taco ideas from the multiple components of a Taco. Allow users to save the generated taco(s) on their "My Tacos" page. Possibly add the ability to locate/source some ingredients or provide links/details to explain what some/all of them are.



Result ----

The "MUST HAVE" features are working and currently the local storage is not functional, not 100% clear as to why at this point but will be working on completing that feature.
